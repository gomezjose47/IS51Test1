program will compare and then determine which pay option is better
First option will pay 100 dollars per day for 10 days. The second option is 
1 dollar per day, and it will be doubled every day for 10 days.
There will be 2 functions, The first will calculate the pay rate for the first option
Function 2 will calculate the amount of the second function.
Function1 will return $100 * 10 days.
Function2 will be a loop function and it will loop 10 times, each time doubling the amount and adding the amount to the total.
If Option1 is better we will output "Option1 is better"
If Option2 is better, we will output "Option2 is better"
If Option1 and Option2 are equal, we will output, "Option1 and Option2 have the same payrate"
